# Raspberry Pi OS alt
"Raspberry Pi OS alt" is a set of scripts that simplifies and automates the process of building a complete and bootable Debian image for Raspberry Pi SBCs.
 
The goal of this project is to build a headless and generic Debian image with the Kernel version of your choice. By default, it use the recent one. You can configure the kernel if needed.
 
All of the Raspberry Pi architectures should be supported. Concerning Debian, the lastet release ( Trixie ) still supports arm architectures, but only for upgrades ( https://www.debian.org/releases/trixie/ ). 

It's also possible to build an Ubuntu image but, you will have to dig the code. My project is focused on Debian above all.
